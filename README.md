# LSTM_Next_word_Predictor
This project is a Next Word Prediction system built using an LSTM neural network. It was trained on the Medium Articles dataset to learn word patterns and context, enabling it to predict the next word given a sequence of text. The model uses tokenization, a vocabulary mapping, and padded sequences to process input efficiently.
